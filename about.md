<p>I was born in the Caribbean island of Dominica (not The Dominican Republic), and I've been interested in computers from the first time I saw them. A good chunk of my time is spent reading technology and science articles and tinkering with different technologies. I like really well designed pieces of software (like Sublime Text, VSCode & Spark), and I hope everything I create eventually meets that bar.</p>

<p>I'm currently enrolled at Minnesota State University, Mankato where I major in Computer Information Technology major, with a minor in Biology. While a somewhat peculiar combination, I've always been interested in life, agriculture and the natural world in general. I also like taking pictures so it's really convenient for me that Mankato happens to be a great place to capture some beautiful shots.</p>
