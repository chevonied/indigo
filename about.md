<p>I was born in the Caribbean island of Dominica (not The Dominican Repulic) and have been interested in computers from the first time I saw them. A good chunk of my time is spent reading technology and science articles and tinkering with different technologies. I'm currently a Computer Information Technology student at Minnesota State University in Mankato with a minor in Biology. While a somewhat peculiar combination, I've always been interested in life, agriculture and the natural world in general. I also like taking pictures so it's really convenient for me that Mankato happens to be a great place to capture beautiful photos.</p>
