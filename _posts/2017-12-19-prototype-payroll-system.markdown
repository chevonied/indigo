This was part of a class group project where we had about two months to design a prototype payroll system that could be used by Federated Insurance. An employee for the company briefed us on the specifications necessary for a company of their size (approx. 2400 employees). These requirements gave us an idea of the business rules to be developed for the creation of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) needed to ensure that the GUI included the  functionality expected.

A number of analyses were conducted to ensure that the system solved the problems faced by the previous payroll system while reducing scope creep. These included:

- Operational, Technical, and Business Feasibility analyses
- A SWOT Analysis
- A Business Case
- Project Scope
- RACI Framework
- Strategic Planning Overview

In order to efficiently co-ordinate our efforts, we employed the Agile framework, Scum and used Slack for most of our communications. We also used Lucidchart to design the ERD, and Java for the GUI. This project helped us understand the importance of clear communication and proper designation of tasks. It also shed light on the large amount of work that goes into developing enterprise software in order to ensure that even the most minute details specific to each company is addressed.

The result of our work was a well designed system that was capable of performed all the functions required. A few pictures of the prototype system can be found below:
