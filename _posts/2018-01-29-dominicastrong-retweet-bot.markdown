In the aftermath of the catastrophic category 5 hurricane (Maria) that ravaged Dominica in September last year, the #DominicaStrong hashtag attained widespread popularity. It united and encouraged a distraught populace that had just witnessed the worst natural disaster in living memory.

To date it has inspired numerous songs, pictures and poems, none of which I want to miss out on. This is why I decided to build a simple twitter bot that retweets posts that include this hashtag that perfectly describes my people.
