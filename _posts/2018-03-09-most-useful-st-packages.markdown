It’s no secret that I enjoy using Sublime Text, both for its aesthetics, and the productivity boost I noticed when using it. So, I figured why not spread the joy around, and hopefully help make another programmer become just a bit more efficient.

To start off, you’ll obviously need to have Sublime Text installed. It’s cross-platform, and the latest version can be downloaded directly from [their website](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). After it’s installed, you’ll need to get Package Control, which only involves pasting some code into the Sublime Text console, the instructions for which can be found [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). If everything is all set up, you can now install packages by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows or `Command + Shift + P` on Mac, choose "Package Control: Install Package", input the package name, and select the one you want.

Finally, here’s the list of Sublime Text packages I consider to be the most useful:

## Side​Bar​Enhancements
Despite it’s apparent simplicity, this is one of the most useful Sublime Text packages. It adds a number of very handy functions to the ST sidebar, since the number of default options are a bit sparse. You can find its official documentation [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements).


## Dayle Rees Color Schemes
Remember all that talk about the aesthetics of Sublime Text that I like so much? Well, this package really helps to bring it out. It brings a large number of different color schemes that make working with ST a real treat. You can find the official documentation [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dayle%20Rees%20Color%20Schemes).


## SublimeLinter
SublimeLinter, is a **very** useful package that helps make ST seem a lot more like an IDE than a text editor. It provides an interface for other language specific packages to provide insight on potential errors in your code. You can find these language specific packages by typing a `-` after SublimeLinter and reading the installation instructions. The documentation can be found [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter).


## Sublime​Code​Intel
Sublime​Code​Intel adds another IDE like function to ST, code completion. Depending on the language you’re using (I’m looking at you Java), this package can save you a good deal of time. You can read the official documentation [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeCodeIntel).


## Emmet
Emmet is a great little tool that aims to reduce the amount of time you spend writing repetitive code, and by repetitive code I mean stuff like HTML tags (it won’t save you from yourself). You can find the Readme [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet).


## Bracket​Highlighter
This useful little package helps by showing you the scope of a function or class while programming, and has a number of customizations. You can read the official documentation [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BracketHighlighter).


## Auto-save
This package, coupled with a browser extension with the same same, saves you from having to press refresh all the time, when working on files open in the browser. The official documentation can be found [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/auto-save)


I hope some of these packages were useful to you, and I’ll try to keep updating this list as I find more great packages. Feel free to contact me with suggestions.
